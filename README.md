# üß† Machine Learning to Analyze Brain of Zebrafish

> This repository summarizes my internship work at **Laboratoire Jean Perrin, Sorbonne Universit√©**, where I applied machine learning techniques ‚Äî specifically, **compositional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (cRBMs)** ‚Äî to analyze neural activity in zebrafish.

## üöÄ Summary

- üß¨ **Project Focus**: Functional connectivity modeling in zebrafish larvae brain using cRBMs.
- üß† **Data**: Whole-brain calcium imaging data (SPIM-based), ~40,000 neurons, voxel-averaged activity.
- ü§ñ **ML Approach**: Compositional Restricted Boltzmann Machines with **L2L1 regularization**.
- üìà **Optimization**: Hyperparameter search for regularization strength (Œª) to balance underfitting/overfitting.
- üîÑ **Generative Modeling**: cRBMs learned hidden assemblies and generated statistically similar neural activity.
- üìä **Analysis**: PCA, K-means clustering, RMSE metrics, and functional connectivity comparisons.
- üß© **Key Finding**: Functional connectivity matrices are consistent across models ‚Äî robust to model imperfections.
- üí° **Tools Used**: Python, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, PCA, k-means, identity plots, heatmaps.

## üìÇ Project Breakdown

### 1. **Scientific Context**
- **Goal**: Extract interpretable neural assemblies and functional connections from large-scale zebrafish brain recordings.
- **Why ML?**: Manual/heuristic methods fail at whole-brain scale; generative models (cRBMs) offer interpretable, scalable alternatives.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
- **cRBMs**: Probabilistic generative models with visible units (voxels) and hidden units (assemblies).
- **Regularization**: Employed custom **L2L1** regularization for controlled sparsity.
- **Training**: Models trained on individual fish using z-scored voxel activity.

### 3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
- **Main Task**: Tune Œª (L2L1 regularization) to:
  - Reduce overfitting
  - Minimize bad models (nRMSE > 1 or NaN)
  - Reproduce key statistics of brain activity
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean voxel activity ‚ü®v‚ü©, hidden unit activity ‚ü®h‚ü©
  - Pairwise interactions: ‚ü®vv‚ü©, ‚ü®vh‚ü©, ‚ü®hh‚ü©
  - **nRMSE** scores used to assess model fidelity

### 4. **Functional Connectivity Analysis**
- **Coupling Matrix**: Computed from learned weights; reflects voxel-to-voxel interaction strength.
- **Consistency Check**:
  - Models with different Œª produce similar coupling matrices
  - Matrix structure is stable across cRBMs ‚Äî even ‚Äúbad‚Äù models
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA showed two clear matrix clusters (based on Œª range).
- **Clustering**: K-means validated that matrix structure stems from regularization-induced sparsity.

### 5. **Key Results**
- ‚úÖ **Optimal Œª ‚âà 0.09**: Best balance between model accuracy and sparsity.
- üìâ **< 10% bad cRBMs** in optimal Œª range.
- üîÅ **Cross-model similarity**: Functional connectivity matrix conserved across cRBMs.
- üß† **Inference**: Robust voxel assemblies exist and are identifiable despite neuron-level noise.
